# What is design and architecture?

## Key points

- Design and architecture are the same.
- We should make architecture matter from the beginning of the project.
- The goal of this book is to describe how clean design and architecture looks like.

## Summary

It is considered that design and architecture are differente things; architecture talks about high leve decisions that are completely separated from the low-level details, which are usually considered a matter of design. 

The author states that there's no difference between them, since they are part of a whole, where low-level details support the high-level decisions. He concludes saying that the goal of both id "minimize human resources needed to build and maintain a system". From this last point, the author introduces thge objective of this chapter and, ultimately, the goal of the book itself:

Writing bad code "fast", with the promise of cleaining it later, is just a lie we tell to ourselves. It's proven that bad code slows us down and we will probably never clean it up. So, the quality of desing and architecture should matter from the beginning. To make it matter, you need to know how good architecture looks like. 

And that last point, my friends, is the goal of this book: describe how clean design and architecture looks like.
